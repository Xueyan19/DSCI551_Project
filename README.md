# DSCI551_Project

This is my DSCI551 Final Project

Since we have "import sqlite3" and "import pandas as pd". You need to use pip install to install sqlite3 and pandas.


For the input part, you can just give the input query as I mentioned in the code.

Here I have one ipynb jupyter notebook file and also one .py file. Jupyter notebook file will be more useful.
